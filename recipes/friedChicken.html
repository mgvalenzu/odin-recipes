    <h2>A sugar and salt-spiked whole-milk brine makes this chicken sweet and juicy; a mixture of buttermilk, flour, baking powder, and baking soda yields an extra-crisp crust.</h2>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 quart whole milk, divided</li>
        <li>3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
        <li>2 (4-pound) chickens, each cut into 8 pieces</li>
        <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sweet paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon hot sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>About 5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 quart vegetable oil, for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small saucepan, combine 1 cup of the milk with 3/4 cup of kosher salt and the sugar. Stir over moderate heat just until the sugar and salt dissolve, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a large, deep bowl and add the remaining 3 cups of milk. Add the chicken pieces and refrigerate for 4 hours. Drain the chicken and pat thoroughly dry.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, mix the buttermilk, eggs, 2 tablespoons of salt, the paprika, hot sauce, and pepper. Whisk in the baking powder and baking soda. Put half of the flour in a large bowl. Working with a few pieces at a time, dredge the chicken in the flour, tapping off any excess. Dip the chicken in the buttermilk, letting the excess drip off; return the chicken to the flour and turn to coat. Transfer to a rack. Repeat with the remaining chicken, adding more flour as needed. If the flour becomes too lumpy, sift it.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in 2 large, deep skillets until shimmering. Working in batches, add the chicken to the skillets in a single layer, without crowding, and fry over moderate heat, turning occasionally, until deep golden and cooked through, 18 to 20 minutes; an instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should register 160Â°F. Drain the chicken on wire racks lined with paper towels and fry the remaining pieces. Serve hot or warm.</li>
    </ol>
