    <h2>Perfectly golden, crisp breaded and fried chicken cutlets are an incredibly comforting dish. Serve the chicken katsu with tonkatsu sauce, Dijon mustard, and steamed sushi rice.</h2>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 skinless, boneless chicken thighs (about 6 ounces each)</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 large eggs, lightly beaten with 3 tablespoons of water</li>
        <li>3 cups panko breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>3 cups vegetable oil, divided</li>
        <li>Tonkatsu sauce, for serving (see Note)</li>
        <li>Dijon mustard, for serving</li>
        <li>Steamed sushi rice, for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Lightly pound the chicken thighs 1/2 inch-thick and season with salt.</li>
        <li>Put the flour, eggs, and panko in three separate pie plates and season each one lightly with salt.</li>
        <li>Dredge 1 piece of chicken in the flour, tapping off the excess. <br> Dip in the egg, allowing the excess to drip off, then coat the chicken with the panko, pressing to help it adhere. <br> Transfer the chicken to a wax paperâ€“lined baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining chicken.</li>
        <li>Divide the oil between two large skillets and heat until shimmering. Add the chicken and fry over moderately high heat, turning once, until golden and crispy, 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Serve the chicken with tonkatsu sauce, mustard, and steamed rice.</li>
    </ol>
